# ÂµGameTools

This project provides a bunch of simple widgets to emulate the common game equipment needed when playing board games or card games : Dice, sandtimers, score counters...

It focuses on simplicity, and on the idea it will be used as a companion during "real" table-top gaming.

## Features

- Virtual board-game tools:
  - SandTimer
  - Counter
  - Dice
  - Sequence/CountDown follower
- Template file loading (in json format)
