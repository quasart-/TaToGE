TaToGE allows you to emulate the common game equipment needed when playing board games or card games: Dice, sandtimers, score counters...

It focuses on simplicity, and on the idea it will be used as a companion during "real" table-top gaming.

## Typical use

- When you have equipment missing, or when rolling real dice would be too noisy.
- When you need custom random generator, for example to choose who will pay the beers.
- When role-playing game master wants a clean customizable dashboard.
- When you want to project game status on big screen.

## Get started
